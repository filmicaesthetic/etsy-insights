## Etsy Product Recommender

This is a simple product recommender designed to provide Etsy sellers with a list of complimentary products from their own store based on past purchases by seeing which products were most frequently bought together.

It takes the standard Etsy formatted .CSV file, available for download from Settings > Options > Download Data > "Order Items" as input.
